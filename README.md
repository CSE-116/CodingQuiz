# Coding Quiz

You should follow these steps exactly as you set up your repo. Failure to do so will result in a compilation 
error when you submit your code.

1. Clone the Repo
2. In IntelliJ, right-click the "src" directory in the file tree on the left.
3. Hover over "New" and click Package
4. Type in "quiz" (case-sensitive) and press enter.
5. When you get your question from Autolab, right-click the "quiz" package, hover over "New" and click "Java Class"
6. Type in the exact name of the class as specified in Autolab (also case-sensitive. ClassName != classname).

You have a test package containing a class named QuizTest. You may write whatever unit tests you wish in this 
class, but they will not be considered by the autograder and are completely optional. If you choose to write them,
keep in mind that your tests will not be checked for correctness.
